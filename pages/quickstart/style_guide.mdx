# Style Guide

import Hlt from '../../components/Hlt'

- Place each sentence on its own line.
  - Consecutive non-blank lines will be rendered as normal paragraphs.

- This is a [serial/Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) house.
  - "Eats, shoots<Hlt> , </Hlt> and leaves".
  - [*Cf.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cf.) these [guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_i1xk07o4g) => catchy, but they are clearly wrong.

- Footnote format
  - Use this syntax to mark the footnote inline with the text:

    ```markdown
    Some words.[^1] More words.
    ```

  - Then at the bottom of the file:

    ```markdown
    [^1]: This is footnote text.
    ```

- Let's standardize the capitalization of our terms:
  - OpenAPI Specification
  - Deploy Guard
  - Signet broker (should we capitalize broker?)

[^1]: This is footnote text.
