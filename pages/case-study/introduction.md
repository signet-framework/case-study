# Introduction

**Signet** is an open-source contract testing framework for microservices.
It promotes spec-first API design, and enables teams to build microservices in parallel with the confidence that they will be compatible when deployed.<!-- alternative to previous sentence: "It enables multiple teams to build microservices in parallel with the confidence that they will be compatible when deployed." -->

Signet is designed for rapidly-scaling applications that want to introduce contract testing with minimal cost and configuration.

The following case study introduces the problems that led us to build Signet.
It explores the trade-offs involved in Signet's design, and the challenges encountered in its implementation.
