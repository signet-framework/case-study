# Signet Framework

As small companies experience growth, maintaining a scalable and reliable microservices architecture becomes crucial. Development teams working on interdependent microservices need a robust contract testing framework to ensure compatibility and effective collaboration. Signet, an open-source, self-hosted framework for spec-driven contract testing, addresses these challenges.

## Who is Signet for?

Signet is designed for small companies experiencing growth and utilizing a microservices architecture. It addresses the needs of development teams that seek an efficient and standardized approach to contract testing. The framework is ideal for teams aiming for seamless collaboration, early issue identification, and a reliable testing process for their microservices.

Adopting a spec-driven approach offers significant advantages. Spec-driven contract testing promotes parallel development, allowing multiple teams to work concurrently on different microservices. By ensuring that each service aligns with the expected specifications, this approach accelerates the overall development process, enabling companies to deliver new features and updates more efficiently. Furthermore, testing against well-defined contracts ensures APIs adhere to agreed specifications, leading to increased reliability and reduced production errors.
