# Introducing Signet

**Signet** is an open-source, self-hosted framework for spec-driven contract testing of microservices.

It is designed for small, rapidly scaling companies experiencing the challenges that come with integration and E2E testing.
Getting started with Signet requires minimal upfront costs, eliminating the need to write new unit tests.
Its feature set answers the fundamental question that drives teams to adopt contract testing: will something break if I deploy this new version of my service?

## Core Features

### Spec-driven Model

A core value of Signet is maximizing the independent deployability of services.
For that reason, Signet uses a spec-driven approach to contract testing, where the details of the integration are defined first in an API spec.
Establishing the contract ahead of time enables parallel development, where multiple teams can work concurrently on different microservices.
By ensuring that each service aligns with the expected specifications, this approach accelerates the overall development process, enabling companies to rapidly deliver new features and updates.

### Open-source

Signet is open-source, allowing developers to directly modify and extend the framework according to their specific needs.
This enables valuable customization and flexibility for small companies.
By self-hosting Signet, companies don't need to pay for another managed service, maintain complete ownership of their data, and retain control of their testing infrastructure.

### Easy to Adopt

One of Signet's key strengths lies in its ease of adoption.
It offers the ability to leverage existing service tests to **automatically generate the consumer contract**.
This saves companies from the time-consuming and error-prone processes of writing new unit tests to get started with contract testing.

Signet also offers built-in support for **provider verification**.
While some spec-driven solutions require companies to wire up their own tool, Signet offers this feature out of the box.
Signet uses the API spec to generate tests that verify that the provider correctly implements the spec.

Moreover, organizations can deploy the Signet broker to their existing AWS cloud with a single command.
The Signet CLI provisions an ECS Fargate cluster along with all of the necessary supporting infrastructure.
This deployment strategy makes it simple to set up Signet and scale its capacity as needed.

### Dedicated Broker

Rather than storing contracts in standard version control, Signet uses a dedicated broker to provide a richer set of features.

Testing that a service satisfies a contract is not enough by itself.
What developers really care about is whether anything will break when a new service version is deployed to an environment.
This requires the additional step of identifying the current set of relevant contracts, a potentially onerous task that most solutions leave up to the developer.

Signet's **Deploy Guard** feature tracks the deployment of service versions, making it easy to see if a new service is safe to deploy.
It verifies the presence and compatibility of all of the service's providers in the environment.
It also ensures that the service won't break any of the consumers that rely on it.

Signet's broker also **integrates with CI/CD pipelines** through webhooks and the Signet CLI.
CI/CD pipelines can subscribe to receive webhooks from the Signet broker, allowing them to respond to new contract testing events.
Additionally, the contract testing workflow can be fully automated through the Signet CLI, enabling CI/CD pipelines to gate deployments if they would introduce breaking changes.
