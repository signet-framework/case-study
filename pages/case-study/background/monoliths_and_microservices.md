# Of Monoliths and Microservices

**Signet** addresses specific challenges with testing applications composed of microservices.
Before exploring those challenges, we will discuss the attributes of microservices which underpin the decisions we made when designing Signet.

## What is a Monolith?

Microservices are best introduced in contrast to *monoliths*.
In a **monolithic architecture**, all of an application's business logic is deployed together as a single unit.

Typically, this means that each business domain is modeled by one or more programming constructs (*e.g.* class or module) that are stored in a shared repository.
When deployed, the application runs as a single process, allowing business domains to interact with each other through in-memory method calls.

## What are Microservices?

In a **microservice architecture**, the application is split up into *independently deployable services*. Each service represents a single business domain.

A **service** can be thought of as a miniature application which encapsulates its own business logic and data.
A service exposes an interface so that other services can consume its functionality through messages sent over the network.

### Benefits of Microservices

Well-designed microservices enable high scalability, while also allowing teams to ship new features quickly.

A key characteristic of a well-designed microservice architecture is *independent deployability* of its services.
**Independent deployability** means that each service can be updated and re-deployed independently of other services.
Changing one service should not require other services to change in lock-step, and each team should be able to re-deploy their services without coordinating with other teams.
Services can thus evolve independently as long as their APIâ€™s remain backwards-compatible.
This allows an organization to ship new features quickly even as the size of the application grows.

Microservices also promote **clear boundaries of ownership**.
Each team of engineers is responsible for one or more microservices and only need to know how their own services are implemented.
This gives teams a narrow scope, allowing them to own the full life-cycle of their services, from development, to testing and deployment, to post-deployment monitoring.

## Testing Microservices

In order to realize the benefits of microservices, care must be taken to ensure that independent deployability and clear ownership are maintained throughout the development life cycle.
In the next section we will examine why it is difficult to protect these benefits when testing the integration of multiple services.
